====================================================

✅ Your environment is ready! Here's how to use it:

📋 STEP-BY-STEP INSTRUCTIONS:
----------------------------------------------------

1. 📹 PREPARE YOUR VIDEO:
   - Name your video exactly: "Vertical Jump.mp4"
   - Place it in this directory: c:\Users\purus\Desktop\vj\
   - Ensure the person is fully visible throughout the video
   - Good lighting and minimal background clutter work best

2. 🎯 RUN THE ANALYSIS:
   Open PowerShell/Command Prompt and run:
   
   cd "c:\Users\purus\Desktop\vj"
   .\.venv\Scripts\python.exe jump_analyzer_enhanced.py

3. 🎮 DURING PROCESSING:
   - Watch the real-time skeleton tracking
   - Press SPACE to pause/resume
   - Press 'Q' to quit
   - Press 'S' to skip 60 frames

4. 📊 GET YOUR RESULTS:
   After processing, you'll get:
   - enhanced_jump_analysis_output.mp4 (processed video)
   - jump_analysis_enhanced.png (analysis graphs)
   - Console output with detailed metrics

🛠️ TROUBLESHOOTING:
----------------------------------------------------
If you get errors:

❌ "Video file not found":
   → Make sure your video is named exactly "Vertical Jump.mp4"

❌ TensorFlow errors:
   → Run: .\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pip install --upgrade tensorflow

❌ OpenCV errors:
   → Run: .\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pip install --upgrade opencv-python

❌ Out of memory:
   → Try with a shorter video or lower resolution

🎯 TIPS FOR BEST RESULTS:
----------------------------------------------------
✅ Video Quality:
   - 30+ FPS for smooth tracking
   - 1080p or higher resolution
   - Stable camera position
   - Person fully visible in frame

✅ Lighting & Background:
   - Good, even lighting
   - Avoid shadows on the person
   - Simple background (avoid clutter)
   - Contrasting colors between person and background

✅ Jump Technique:
   - Perform clear, distinct jumps
   - Allow 2-3 seconds between jumps
   - Full crouch before each jump
   - Land completely before next jump

🔍 UNDERSTANDING YOUR RESULTS:
----------------------------------------------------
📊 Explosive Power Score:
   - 800+: Excellent (Elite athlete level)
   - 600-800: Very Good (Competitive athlete)
   - 400-600: Good (Recreational athlete)
   - 200-400: Fair (Beginner fitness level)
   - <200: Needs Improvement

📈 Power Consistency:
   - 90%+: Very consistent technique
   - 70-90%: Good consistency
   - 50-70%: Moderate variation
   - <50%: Highly variable technique
